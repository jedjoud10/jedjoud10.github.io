Hello and welcome to my first website!

I'm Jed, and I'm ~~a senior high school~~ a Computer Science student at UofG (Class of '29)!!!

This is my personal blog where I will be posting about new programming related things. I will also be posting about my personal projects and retrospectives. I might as well write up some very obscure blogs about how I implemented something or about me ranting about my frustrations over time, so uh, take my blogs with a grain of salt most of the time. 

**>:3**

Also if you have not noticed already I have a VTuber as profile picture. I have no shame, pride, nor any reason *not* to put my favourite VTuber.
I **love** you Shirakami Fubuki.
You are the only light in my world. <br>
<sub> (it's ok Botan I still love you too, just not as much) <sub>
