Hello and welcome to my first website!

I'm Jed and I'm a student studying Computer Science at University of Guelph ('29)

This is my personal blog where I'll be posting about programming related things like my personal projects and retrospectives.
My blogs would mostly range from me yapping about some implementation-specific details or about me ranting my frustrations over a specific issue. 

<!---
Also if you have not noticed already I have a VTuber as profile picture. I have no shame, pride, nor any reason *not* to put my favourite VTuber.
I **love** you Shirakami Fubuki.
You are the only light in my world. <br>
<sub> (it's ok Botan I still love you too, just not as much) <sub>

The self-deprecating impostor syndrome-induced voices might be loud but the manic episode ego-boost voices are louder, we stay silly :3

Font is **Roboto Mono** from Google Fonts btw

If you wanna chat about programming or anything in general feel free to add me on Discord: ``nodle man``
