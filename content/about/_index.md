Hello and welcome to my first website!

I'm Jed and I'm a student studying Computer Science at McMaster University ('29)

This is my personal blog where I'll be posting about programming related things like my personal projects and retrospectives.
My blogs would mostly range from me yapping about some implementation-specific details or about me ranting my frustrations over a specific issue. 

Font is **Roboto Mono** from Google Fonts btw

If you wanna chat about programming or anything in general feel free to add me on Discord: ``nodle man``
